Predicting User Enrollment in Paid Products
Project Summary
In today’s competitive landscape, companies with mobile apps often provide free products or services to attract customers, with the ultimate goal of transitioning them into paid memberships. However, marketing budgets are limited, and indiscriminate targeting can lead to wasted resources. This project focuses on identifying users who are unlikely to enroll in paid memberships so that additional offers and promotions can be targeted effectively, maximizing ROI and reducing unnecessary costs.

Using machine learning, this project provides actionable insights and predictive models to help businesses efficiently allocate their marketing resources and focus on users who are most likely to benefit from promotions.

Why Solve This Problem?
Resource Optimization: Marketing campaigns are costly. Knowing who to target helps save money and improves conversion rates.
Business Growth: Focusing on the right users increases paid membership enrollments, ensuring better monetization.
Scalable Solution: The insights and models developed can be applied to various domains, including streaming platforms, fitness apps, and more.
Project Workflow
Problem Definition:

Identify the critical business need: Who is unlikely to enroll, and how can we predict them?
Highlight the importance of solving this problem for ROI and customer engagement.
Hypothesis:

Users with fewer app interactions or who don't engage with premium features are less likely to enroll.
Younger or older age groups may show varying levels of interest in paid memberships.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand user behavior patterns: number of screens visited, app usage time, and premium feature engagement.
Visualize data trends across age, time of login, and day of the week.
Highlight key observations, such as the correlation between premium feature usage and enrollment rates.
Feature Engineering:

Transform raw data into meaningful features like session activity, engagement levels, and time-based patterns.
Machine Learning Model Development:

Implement multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Compare performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
Select the best-performing model and justify its suitability.
Results & Recommendations:

Present clear, actionable insights for marketing teams.
Provide a user segmentation strategy based on model predictions.
